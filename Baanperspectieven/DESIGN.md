###Framework mapping

Use the decomposition you made earlier to map parts of the solution on the framework(s) that you are using. Think about and fully express how the user interface will be handled, where the data is coming from, and how the various parts will work together to form a complete application. Remember, it is expected that you separate the user interface from the data provider whenever possible.

Some parts that you may describe here:

a list of classes and public methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that you’ve decided to implement
advanced sketches of UIs that clearly explain which features are connected to which underlying classes
a list of APIs and frameworks that you will be using to provide functionality in your app
a list of data sources, and database tables and fields (and their types) that you’ve decided to implement
If your application has multiple independent programs working together (e.g. to clean your dataset) you need to provide a high-level overview of these components and then provide a lowel-level overview of the inner workings of each component.
